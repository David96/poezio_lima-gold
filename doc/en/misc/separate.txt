Using several accounts
======================

Poezio does not support multi-accounts, and we do not plan to do so in a
foreseeable future. However, you can run several poezio instances (e.g. with
tmux or screen) to have similar functionnality.

You can specify a different configuration file than the default with:

[source, bash]
 ./launch.sh -f separate_config.cfg


The relevant options for a separate config are the following:

* *plugins_dir*: A different directory for the plugin sources (not _that_ useful)
* *log_dir*: A different directory for logs
* *plugins_conf_dir*: A different directory for plugin configurations ; useful for the GPG plugin, for example.

Those options are detailed in the link:../configure.html[configuration page].
