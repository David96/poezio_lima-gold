Message Correction
==================

Poezio implements the link:http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0308.html[XEP-0308]
which allows the correction of the last message sent.

The corrections are signalled with a number append to the nick of the user, in
a different color.

image::../../images/correct.png["Corrected message", title="A corrected message"]

The *9* here represents the number of times this message has been corrected.


You can show the revisions of a message by loading the
link:../plugins/display_corrections.html[display_corrections] plugin, and you
can correct your own messages with the */correct* command.


NOTE: Please do not abuse of this feature, as it will simply be displayed as
another message in the other clients.
