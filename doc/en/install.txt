Poezio in the GNU/Linux distributions
-------------------------------------

As far as I know, Poezio is available in the following distributions, you just
 have to install it by using the package manager of the distribution, if you're
 using one of these.

* *Archlinux*: A poezio and poezio-git packages are in AUR (use your favourite
 AUR wrapper to install them)
* *Frugalware*: Just use pacmang-g2 to install the poezio package. (Thanks to
 its maintainer, Kooda)
* *Debian*: Use an other distro.

(If an other distribution provides a poezio package, please tell us and we will
 add it to the list)


Install poezio from the sources
-------------------------------

You can download poezio's https://dev.louiz.org/project/poezio/download[stable
 sources] or fetch the development version (trunk), using git:
============================
git clone https://git.louiz.org/poezio
============================

In order for poezio to correctly work, you need the libs SleekXMPP and
 dnspython. You can install them by downloading it from the
 https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP/[SleekXMPP] page and the
 http://www.dnspython.org/[dnspython] page , but you'll need the development
 versions. Alternatively, you can download poezio's sources including SleekXMPP
 and dnspython, that's the easier way.

As for dnspython, you will have to use our python3 fork, or poke them to accept
 patches.

=== Dependencies ===


If you want to install SleekXMPP and dnspython yourself, follow these
 instructions. Else, go to the next section.


Download SleekXMPP
============================
git clone git://github.com/louiz/SleekXMPP.git
============================

Make sure you're using the develop branch by typing
============================
cd SleekXMPP

git checkout develop
============================

Install SleekXMPP with
============================
python3 setup.py build

su -c "python3 setup.py install"
============================

Clone the repository at http://hg.louiz.org/dnspython (this is a fork, because
 upstream is unresponsive and didnâ€™t fix an important bug).
============================
hg clone http://hg.louiz.org/dnspython

cd dnspython
============================

And do the same again:
============================
python3 setup.py build

su -c "python3 setup.py install"
============================


=== Poezio installation ===

If you skipped the installation of the dependencies and you only want to test
 poezio without a system-wide install, do, in the _poezio_ directory:
============================
sh update.sh
============================

If you have git and hg installed, it will download and update locally the
 libraries for you.


If you don't want to install poezio but just test it, do:
============================
 ./launch.sh
============================


To install poezio, do, as root (or sudo with ubuntu or whatever):
============================
make install
============================

And then start it with:
============================
poezio
============================
