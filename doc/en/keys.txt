Keys
====

This file describes the default keys of poezio and explains how to
configure them.

By default, most keys manipulating the input (where you type your
messages and commands) behave like emacs does.

Note that keys are case sensitive. Ctrl-X is not the same than Ctrl-x

Key configuration
-----------------
Bindings are keyboard shortcut aliases. You can use them
to define your own keys to replace the default ones.
where ^x means Control + x
and M-x means Alt + x

To know exactly what the code of a key is, just run
==================
python3 src/keyboard.py
==================
And enter any keys

.Turn Alt-i into a tab key (completion, etc)
==================
M-i = ^I
==================
