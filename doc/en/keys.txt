Keys
====

This file describes the default keys of poezio and explains how to
configure them.

By default, most keys manipulating the input (where you type your
messages and commands) behave like emacs does.

Note that keys are case sensitive. Ctrl-X is not the same than Ctrl-x

Key bindings listing
--------------------
Some key bindings are available only in some tabs, others are global.

Global keys
~~~~~~~~~~~
These keys work in *any* tab.

*Ctrl-n*:: Go to the next tab.

*Ctrl-p*:: Go to the previous tab.

*Alt-number*:: Go to tab number x.

*Alt-j*:: Waits for you to type a two-digits number. Go to tab number xx.

Input keys
~~~~~~~~~~
These keys concern only the inputs.

*Ctrl-a*:: Move the cursor to the beginning of line.

*Ctrl-e*:: Move the cursor to the end of line.

Chat tab input keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These keys work in any conversation tab (MultiUserChat, Private or Conversation tabs)

*Key Up*:: Use the previous message from the message history.

*Key Down*:: Use the next message from the message history.

*Page Up*:: Scroll up in the conversation by x lines, where x is the height of the conversation window - 1.

*Page Down*:: Likfe Page Up, but down.

*Alt-/*:: Complete what youâ€™re typing using the "recent" words from the current conversation, if any.

Key configuration
-----------------
Bindings are keyboard shortcut aliases. You can use them
to define your own keys to replace the default ones.
where ^x means Control + x
and M-x means Alt + x

To know exactly what the code of a key is, just run
==================
python3 src/keyboard.py
==================
And enter any keys

.Turn Alt-i into a tab key (completion, etc)
==================
M-i = ^I
==================
