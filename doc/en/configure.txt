Configure
=========

The configuration is located in the file *~/.config/poezio/poezio.cfg*
On its first startup, poezio will create that file (and its containing
directories) with the default configuration. You can edit that file manually
or use the */set* command to edit some of its values directly from poezio.
This file is also used to configure key bindings, but this is explained
in the link:keys.html[Keys] documentation file.

That file is read at each startup and the configuration is saved when poezio
is closed.

This configuration file *requires* all global options to be in a section
named [Poezio]. Some other options can be in optional sections and will
apply only to tabs having the option’s name.

An option is formatted with the form
======================
option = value
======================

An empty value *doesn’t* mean that the default value will be used. That’s
just an empty value. To use the default value, just comment or remove the
option entirely.

Here is a list of all the available configuration options, their meaning
and their default value.

Configuration options
---------------------

Global section options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These options have a sense when they are in the global section. Some of
them can also be in an optional configuration section, see the next
section of this documentation.

  Whether or not to add a space after a completion in the middle of the
  input (not at the start of it)

*after_completion*:: ,

  What will be put after the name, when using autocompletion at the
  beginning of the input. A space will always be added after that

*alternative_nickname*:: [empty]

  If you want poezio to join the room with an alternative nickname when
  your nickname is already in use in the room you wanted to join, put
  a non-empty value. If you don’t, poezio won't join the room
  This value will be added to your nickname to create the alternative nickname.
  For example, if you set "\_", and wanted to use the nickname "john",
  your alternative nickname will be "john_".
 
*autorejoin*:: false

  Set to true if you want to automatically rejoin the room when you're kicked.

*autorejoin_delay*:: 5

  Set to the number of seconds before reconnecting after getting kicked.
  0, a negative value, or no value means you reconnect instantly.
  This option only works if autorejoin is enabled.

*auto_reconnect*:: false

  Auto-reconnects you when you get disconnected. Should not be necessary, so
  the default is false.

*beep_on*:: highlight private

  The terminal can beep on various event. Put the event you want in a list
  (separated by spaces).
  The events can be
  - highlight (when you are highlighted in a MUC)

             someone from a MUC)
  - message (any message from a MUC)

*ca_cert_path*:: [empty]

  Path to the certificate of the Certification Authority.
  As some services may keep different certificates, it is an alternative to
  the Trust On First Use model provided by the “certificate” option.

  may be active at the same time.

*certificate*:: [empty]

  The fingerprint of the SSL certificate as a hexadecimal string, you should
  not touch it, except if know what you are doing.

*custom_host*:: [empty]

  This option can be combined with custom_host.
  You should not need this in a "normal" use case.

*default_nick*:: [empty]

  the nick you will use when joining a room with no associated nick
  If this is empty, the $USER environnement variable will be used

*display_user_color_in_join_part*:: false

  messages, instead of the default color from the theme.

*enable_vertical_tab_list*:: false

 If true, a vertical list of tabs, with their name, is displayed on the left of
 the screen.

*enable_xhtml_im*:: true

  Set to true if you want to see colored (and otherwise formatted) messages.

*exec_remote*:: false

  If this is set to true, poezio will try to send the commands to a FIFO
  instead of executing them locally. This is to be used in conjunction with
  ssh and the daemon.py file. See the /link documentation for details.

  A list of words or sentences separated by colons (":"). All the
  informational mesages (described above) containing at least one of those
  values will not be shown.

*hide_exit_join*:: -1

  Exact same thing than hide_status_change, except that it concerns
  the quit message, and that it will be hidden only if the value is 0.
  Default setting means:
   - all quit and join notices will be displayed

*hide_status_change*:: 120

  Set a number for this setting.
  The join OR status-change notices will be
  displayed according to this number.
  -1: the notices will ALWAYS be displayed
   0: the notices will NEVER be displayed

  a list of words (separated by a colon (:)) that will be
  highlighted if said by someone on a room

*ignore_certificate*:: false

  security perspective.

*information_buffer_popup_on*:: error roster warning help info

  Some informational messages (error, a contact getting connected, etc)
  are sometimes added to the information buffer. These settings can make
  that buffer grow temporarly so you can read these information when they
  appear.

  A list of message types that should make the information buffer grow
  Possible values: error, roster, warning, info, help

*jid*:: [empty]

  Jabber identifiant. Specify it only if you want to connect using an existing

  It should be in the form nickname@server.tld

*lang*:: en

  The lang some automated entities will use when replying to you.

*lazy_resize*:: true

  The number of line to preload in a chat buffer when it opens. The lines are
  loaded from the log files. 0 or a negative value here disable that option.

*log_dir*:: [empty]

  If log_dir is not set, logs will be saved in $XDG_DATA_HOME/poezio/logs,

  you want to use instead. This directory will be created if it doesn't exist

*max_lines_in_memory*:: 2048

  Configure the number of maximum lines (for each tab) that
  can be kept in memory. If poezio consumes too much memory, lower these
  values

  Limit the number of messages you want to receive when the
  multiuserchat rooms send you recent history
  0: You won't receive any
  -1: You will receive the maximum

  pops up.
  If the message takes more than one line, the popup will stay visible
  two more second per additional lines.

*remote_fifo_path*:: ./poezio.fifo

  The path of the FIFO used to send the commands (see the exec_remote option).

*resource*:: [empty]

  The resource you will use. If it's empty, your resource will be chosen
  (most likely randomly) by the server. t is not recommended to use a
  resource that is easy to guess, because it can lead to presence leak.

*rooms*:: poezio@muc.poezio.eu

  the rooms you will join automatically on startup, with associated
  nickname or not.
  Format : room@server.tld/nickname:room2@server.tld/nickname2
  The default_nick option will be used if "/nickname" is not specified.

*roster_group_sort*:: name

  How to sort the roster groups. The principles are the same as _roster_sort_
  (see below).

  Available methods are:
    * reverse: reverse the current sorting
    * name: sort by group name (alphabetical order)
    * fold: sort by unfolded/folded
    * connected: sort by number of connected contacts
    * size: sort by group size
    * none: put the "none" group (if any) at the end of the list

*roster_show_offline*:: false

  Set this to true if you want to display the offline contacts too.

*roster_sort*:: jid:show

  How you want the contacts to be sorted inside the roster groups. The given
  methods are used sequentially (from left to right), so the last one is the
  one on the far right.

  Available methods are :
    * reverse: reverse the current sorting
    * jid: sort by JID (alphabetical order)
    * show: sort by show (available/away/xa/…)
    * name: sort by roster name (if no name, then the bare jid is used)
    * resource: sort by resource number
    * online: sort by online presence (online or not)

  Those methods can be arranged however you like, and they have to be
  separated by colons (":"). If there are more than 3 or 4 chained
  sorting methods, your sorting is most likely inefficient.

*save_status*:: true

  Save the status automatically in the status and status_message options.

*send_chat_states*:: true

  if true, chat states will be sent to the people you are talking to.
  Chat states are, for example, messages informing that you are composing

  with no activity, set to true. Else, set to false

*show_muc_jid*:: true

  Set this to false if you want to display only the “user” part of the MUC
  jid. E.g. if you have poezio@muc.poezio.eu, it will be displayed as
  `poezio`. This will be used only if use_tab_nicks is set to true.

*show_roster_jids*:: true

  Set this to false if you want to hide the JIDs in the roster (and keep only
  the contact names). If there is no contact name, the JID will still be
  displayed.

*show_s2s_errors*:: true

  true if you want to have them shown instead of the jid of the contact.

*theme*:: [empty]

  through recent words completion. They must be separated bu a colon (:). That
  completion will work in chatrooms, private conversations, and direct
  conversations.


Optional section options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These option can appear in optional sections. These section are named
after a JID. These option will apply only for the given JID. For example
if an option appears in a section named [user@example.com], it will
apply only for the conversations with user@example.com.

If an option appears in a section named [@example.com], it will apply
for all the conversations with people @example.com, except when the option
is already defined in a [user@example.com] section.

The priority of settings is thus like this:
user@example.com > @example.com > Poezio (more specific to less specific)

Note that some of these options can also appear in the global section,
they will be used as a fallback value when no JID-specific option is
found.
