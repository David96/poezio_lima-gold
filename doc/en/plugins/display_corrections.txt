Lists old versions of a corrected message.

 /load display_corrections

============================


Usage
-----
This plugin adds a _/display_corrections_ command that will display a list of
old versions of a message.


_display_corrections_ without argument will list the last corrected message,
if any is found.  If an integer argument is given, _display_corrections_ will
go back gradually in the buffer to list the previous corrected messages, and so
on.


If you are scrolling in the buffer, poezio will list the corrected messages
starting from the first you can see.  (although there are some problems with
multiline messages).
