Poezio is a console Jabber/XMPP client. Its goal is to use anonymous
connections to simply let the user join MultiUserChats. This way, the user
doesn't have to create a Jabber account, exactly like people are using
IRC. Poezio's commands are designed to be (if possible) like IRC
clients (weechat, irssi, etc).
Since version 0.7, poezio can handle real Jabber accounts along with
roster and one to one conversation, making it a full-featured console
Jabber client, but still MultiUserChats-centered.

=======================
	Install
=======================
You need python 3.0 or higher, and the SleekXMPP python library.
You can find my patched version at http://github.com/louiz/SleekXMPP until
my changes (required to properly run poezio) are merged upstream.

you can launch poezio with
sh launch.sh

or you can install it with (as root or with sudo)
make install
(`make uninstall' works, don't worry ;))
you can now simply launch `poezio'

You can edit the config file (~/.config/poezio/poezio.cfg by default)
or data/default_config.cfg (if you want to edit the config before the
first launch)

Please, see the online documentation for more information on installing,
configuring or using poezio:
http://codingteam.net/project/poezio/doc

If you still have questions, or you're lost, don't hesitate to come
talk to us directly on our Jabber chat room (see Contact section).

Please DO report any bug you encounter and ask for any
feature you want.
