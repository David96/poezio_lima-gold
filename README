Poezio is a console Jabber client. Its goal is to use anonymous
connections to let the user join MultiUserChats. This way, the user
doesn't have to create a Jabber account, exactly like people are using
IRC. It doesn't handle contact list at all.
Poezio's commands are designed to be (if possible) like IRC
clients (weechat, irssi, etc).

=======================
	Install
=======================
You need python (with argparse, optionnaly)
and the xmpppy lib at the 0.5.0 version or higher.

you can launch poezio with
sh launch.sh

or you can install it with (as root or with sudo)
make install
(`make uninstall` works, don't worry ;))
you can then simply launch poezio

You can edit the config file (~/.config/poezio/poezio.cfg by default)
or data/default_config.cfg (if you want to edit the config before the
first launch)

See the online documentation for more information:
http://codingteam.net/project/poezio/doc

Please DO report any bug you encounter and ask for any
feature you want.

       The code
======================

Classes:
  - Connection *receives* messages from the Jabber network
  - MultiUserChat *sends* messages to the Jabber network
  - Gui displays everything on the screen and gets the user inputs
  - Handler is the "link" between all these classes :
a class emits a signal and the others classes listen to this signal
and do what they have to do whenever this signal is emitted by any class

Q: Why not use Connection to receive AND send the messages to Jabber network?
A: I like it this way.

Q: Could you please make a nice ASCII art, so I could understand all
   the beauty and the complexity of this awesome software ?
A: Of course, here it is:
