Poezio is a console Jabber/XMPP client.  Its goal is to use anonymous
connections to simply let the user join MultiUserChats.  This way, the user
doesn't have to create a Jabber account, exactly like people are using
IRC.  Poezio's commands are designed to be (if possible) like commonly
used IRC clients (weechat, irssi, etc).
Since version 0.7, poezio can handle real Jabber accounts along with
roster and one to one conversations, making it a full-featured console
Jabber client, but still MultiUserChats-centered.
In the futur, poezio should implement at a 100% level all XEP related to
MUCs, especially XEP 0045.

=======================
	Install
=======================
You need python 3.0 (and the associated devel package, to build C modules)
or higher, and the SleekXMPP python library.
In the developpement version, you’ll need this fork of SleekXMPP
http://github.com/louiz/SleekXMPP.

The simplest way to have up-to-date dependencies and to be able to test
this developpement version is to use the update.sh script that downloads
and places them in the right directory.

You also need to compile some external C modules, to do this, just enter

$ make

you can then launch poezio with

$ ./launch.sh

or you can install it with (as root or with sudo)
$ make install
(`make uninstall' works, don't worry ;))
you can now simply launch `poezio'

You can edit the config file (~/.config/poezio/poezio.cfg by default)
or data/default_config.cfg (if you want to edit the config before the
first launch). The default config file is fully commented.

Please, see the online documentation for more information on installing,
configuring or using poezio:
http://dev.louiz.org/project/poezio/doc

If you still have questions, or if you're lost, don't hesitate to come
talk to us directly on our Jabber chat room (see Contact section).

Please DO report any bug you encounter and ask for any
feature you want.
